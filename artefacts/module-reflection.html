          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>This module focused on developing advanced data management, database design, and analytical competencies, culminating in the creation of an e-portfolio to showcase key artefacts and applied learning. The artefacts include a critical discussion on the Internet of Things (IoT)
            and its data implications, a Security Requirements Specification (SRS) for API integration, a GFS Backup critique, and the MedicaidUK database project evaluation. Each artefact demonstrates a distinct aspect of my progression from theoretical comprehension to practical#
            application of data governance, system security, and analytical design.</p>  
          <p>The most significant component of the module was the group database design project for MedicaidUK, where I contributed to conceptual modelling, schema design, and the evaluation of compliance mechanisms in healthcare data systems. Initially, our proposal (Unit 6) 
            outlined an entity-relationship model using MySQL, designed to manage patient records, treatments, billing, and appointments while complying with UK GDPR. Later, through the Executive Summary (Unit 11), I reflected on how our logical design evolved into a scalable, 
            secure, and regulation-compliant solution.</p>
          <p>Developing the e-portfolio required synthesising artefacts into an accessible digital format, applying both technical skills in HTML/CSS and professional writing. This process encouraged iterative reflection as each artefact built on new skills — from critical 
            evaluation of IoT data frameworks to designing secure APIs and evaluating disaster recovery models. Collectively, the portfolio showcases not only technical competence but also my growing understanding of ethical, regulatory, and social implications of data science.</p>

          <p>Working on the MedicaidUK project revealed the complexity of balancing technical precision with ethical responsibility in data design. At first, I felt apprehensive about integrating healthcare compliance standards into a relational schema. My prior experience in biomedical 
            science helped me understand clinical workflows, yet translating them into a digital model felt daunting. Over time, through team collaboration and research (Connolly & Begg, 2015; Elmasri & Navathe, 2023), I learned to articulate data dependencies and normalisation rules with confidence.</p>
          <p>Emotionally, the transition from theoretical understanding to collaborative implementation was transformative. Initially, I struggled with confidence during team meetings, particularly when technical discussions became complex. However, contributing my healthcare expertise helped 
             the group contextualise our data model for real-world compliance — a turning point in recognising the unique value of interdisciplinary knowledge. As Schön (1983) describes, reflection-in-action enables professionals to adapt in the moment; this process became evident as I learned to 
             apply academic theory dynamically to group challenges.</p>
          <p>Peer discussions and feedback also reshaped my perspective on data governance. While I was inclined to prioritise performance and clinical usability, team input pushed me to consider security first — leading to my later artefact on API Security Requirements. 
            Research by Atlam & Wills (2020) reinforced that ethical data handling requires integrating privacy, transparency, and accountability into technical architecture. This awareness expanded my understanding of cybersecurity as a core data science responsibility 
            rather than an adjunct concern.</p>
          
           <p>Through the IoT Discussion artefact, I critically examined how large-scale data collection creates both opportunity and ethical risk. Initially, I saw IoT primarily as a technological innovation; reflection on readings such as Huxley (2020) and Sardar & Pandey (2024) 
             shifted my focus toward data cleaning and governance, emphasising how analytical outcomes depend on data quality and integrity. Similarly, the GFS Backup reflection prompted me to consider data continuity as part of responsible data stewardship — an aspect often 
             overlooked in analytics-focused coursework.</p>

           <p>Emotionally, I experienced growing satisfaction as technical and ethical awareness began to converge. The iterative process of writing, revising, and publishing each artefact on GitHub enhanced my confidence in presenting professional documentation. 
             Collaboratively, I developed soft skills in communication, time management, and constructive feedback, as well as technical skills in MySQL, UML, and Python integration. Each artefact contributed evidence of learning progression — from conceptual 
             reasoning to applied data governance and security engineering.</p>

           <p>Reflecting on my journey through this module, I now recognise how these experiences have shaped my identity as a developing data professional. The progression from database design to data governance has refined my ability to integrate technical skill with 
             ethical decision making. Going forward, I plan to apply this reflective awareness in both academic and professional contexts.</p>

           <p>The skills developed, including relational schema design, security evaluation, and systematic documentation, will directly inform my future research project on the course, where I hope to explore predictive analytics in healthcare data. 
             I will implement the GDPR-aligned frameworks and validation pipelines learned from MedicaidUK to ensure compliance and reproducibility. Continued reflective practice will allow me to assess how future projects align with ethical and operational standards.</p>

           <p>Additionally, I plan to extend the MedicaidUK concept by exploring hybrid data models integrating MySQL and NoSQL to improve scalability and support unstructured data such as clinician notes and imaging. The teamwork experience reinforced 
             the value of diversity in skillsets; I aim to seek collaborative roles in interdisciplinary projects where data ethics and technical design intersect.  I have started to explore these types of projects at work and this team project has grown my  confidence 
             in putting myself forward to take on such tasks.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, this module taught me that data systems are not just technical artefacts but socio-technical constructs reflecting organisational culture and human values. The reflective practice developed here ensures I remain both technically proficient 
              and ethically grounded in all future data science work.</p>
